# Task Manager (React)

A task management application built with React, allowing users to create, edit, delete, and filter tasks with localStorage persistence. This project showcases my expertise in JavaScript, React hooks (useState, useEffect), component-based architecture, and responsive design. Drawing on my 20+ years as a software engineer and IT director, I designed this app with clean, modular code and a focus on user functionality.

**Features**:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Filter tasks by completion status
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

**Technologies**: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, localStorage

**Setup**:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/PeCoBa/task-manager-react.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run locally: `npm run dev`

**Live Demo**: [Coming soon after deployment!]

**Feedback**: Issues and contributions welcome!
